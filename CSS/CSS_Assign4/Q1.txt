CSS Flexbox:
One-Dimensional Layout: Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column.

Content Order: Flexbox allows you to control the order in which elements appear, which can be different from their order in the source code.

Alignment: Flexbox provides powerful alignment capabilities, both for the items along the main axis and the cross axis.

Responsive Design: It's great for building dynamic and responsive layouts, especially for components like navigation bars, sidebars, or centering content.

CSS Grid:
Two-Dimensional Layout: Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to create rows and columns simultaneously.

Precise Placement: Grid allows you to precisely place items in both rows and columns. This is especially useful for complex layouts where elements need to align in specific ways.

Responsive Design: Like Flexbox, Grid is also great for responsive design, but it's particularly powerful when dealing with larger layout structures.

Overall Page Layouts: Grid is well-suited for defining the overall structure of a page, such as headers, footers, and main content areas.

When to Choose:
Flexbox: Use Flexbox when you are dealing with a single-dimensional layout, like a row or a column, or when you need to reorder elements visually. It's suitable for small-scale layouts or when working with components within a larger layout.

Grid: Use Grid when you need a two-dimensional layout, especially for larger-scale layouts like entire web pages or major sections of a page. It's beneficial when you need precise control over the placement of items in both rows and columns.
