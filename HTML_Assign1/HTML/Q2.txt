In HTML, comments are used to add explanatory notes or annotations to the code. These comments are not displayed on the webpage and are intended for developers or anyone who might read or maintain the HTML code. The purpose of comments is to provide additional information about the code, explain its functionality, or make notes for future reference. Comments are ignored by the browser when rendering the webpage.

HTML comments are enclosed within `<!--` and `-->`. Anything between these delimiters is treated as a comment. Here's an example:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML Comments Example</title>
</head>
<body>

    <!-- This is a comment -->
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>

    <!--
        This is a multi-line comment.
        It provides additional information about the code.
    -->

    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
