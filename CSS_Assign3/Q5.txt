z-index is a CSS property that is used to control the stacking order of positioned elements on a webpage along the z-axis. It is often used when elements overlap, and you want to determine which one appears on top of the others. The element with a higher z-index value will be stacked on top of elements with lower values.
Ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <style>
    .box {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      position: absolute;
    }

    .box1 {
      background-color: red;
      left: 20px;
      top: 20px;
      z-index: 2;
    }

    .box2 {
      background-color: blue;
      left: 50px;
      top: 50px;
      z-index: 1;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="box box1"></div>
  <div class="box box2"></div>
</body>
</html>

In this example, there are two absolutely positioned boxes (box1 and box2). The key part is the z-index property:

.box1 has a z-index of 2.
.box2 has a z-index of 1.

This means that box1 will appear above box2 because it has a higher z-index value. If the z-index values were reversed or not specified, the stacking order would be based on the order in the HTML document or other factors.

It's important to note that z-index only works on positioned elements (i.e., elements with position: relative, position: absolute, or position: fixed). Also, the stacking order is relative to the stacking context. If two elements are in different stacking contexts, their z-index values are not directly comparable.
