Semantic HTML:

Use semantic elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, and <footer> to provide a clear document structure.
Headings and Landmarks:

Use proper heading tags (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) to create a hierarchical structure. Headings help screen reader users navigate and understand the content. Additionally, use landmark roles (<nav>, <main>, <form>, etc.) to identify major sections.
Alternative Text for Images:

Include descriptive alternative text for images using the alt attribute. This is essential for users who rely on screen readers.

Accessible Forms:

Use proper form labels and include helpful instructions. Ensure that form controls are keyboard accessible and test the form using a screen reader.
Keyboard Accessibility:

Ensure that all interactive elements can be operated using a keyboard alone. Test the tab order and make sure that focus is visually noticeable.
