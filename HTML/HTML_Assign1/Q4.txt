HTML Tags:
HTML tags are the building blocks of a web page. They define and structure the content on the page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and most come in pairs â€“ an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag has a forward slash before the tag name.

Example:
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
In this example, <p> is the opening tag, and </p> is the closing tag, encapsulating the paragraph content.

HTML Elements:
An HTML element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Collectively, they define the structure and semantics of the content.

Example:
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
Here, <a> is the opening tag, </a> is the closing tag, and everything in between forms the content of the anchor (link) element.
