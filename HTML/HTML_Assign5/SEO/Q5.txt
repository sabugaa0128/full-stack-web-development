A favicon (short for "favorite icon") is a small, often square image that represents a website or web page. It is typically displayed in the browser's address bar, next to the page's title in bookmarks or favorites, and in browser tabs. Favicon images are commonly 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels in size and are used to enhance brand recognition and provide a visual identifier for a website.

Illustrative Example:
Let's say you have a website named "Example.com," and you want to create a favicon for it. You would design a small square image, often in .ico, .png, or .svg format, and save it with the name "favicon.ico" in the root directory of your website. Here's a simplified example in HTML:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
  <title>Example.com</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your website content goes here -->
</body>
</html>

In this example:

The <link> tag with rel="icon" specifies the location of the favicon, in this case, "favicon.ico."
The type="image/x-icon" attribute specifies the file type.
The favicon.ico file is expected to be in the root directory of the website.
